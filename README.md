# Binary-to-Hexadecimal-Converter
This Python application converts a binary (base-2) number to a hexadecimal (base-16) number.
You can enter any real number in the binary (base-2) form as a string (for now), and then the function will return a string representing the hexadecimal (base-16) version of the number.
